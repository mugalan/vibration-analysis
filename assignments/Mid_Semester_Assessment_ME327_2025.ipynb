        "An apparatus consists of an pinned-pinned axially loaded beam with axial load $P$ and Length $L$. A motor of negligible mass is mounted on the beam at $L/2$. The properties of the beam are: a=1e-2 m; b=5e-3 m; L=1 m. There are three other rotary machines that operate in close proximity of the apparatus. An accelerometer is mounted on the motor at $L/2$. Two sets of data are collected, at a sampling frequency of $5\\,kHz$, for two operating conditions of the motor that cause large amplitude vibrations of the beam. For the lower frequency motion the maximimum amplitude of vibration is measured to be about $4.3\\,mm$.\n",
